The objective of this project is to construct a database that will serve as part of the data repository for a made up organization. 7 entity tables were designed, along with their corresponding attributes and descriptions. Business Rules used by the organization describing the relationships between the entities were developed and displayed within the EER Diagram. A normalized 3 NF model based off of the EER Diagram was designed as well. SQL queries were then constructed to create all the defined tables within the database, load data into these tables, and retrieve information from these tables. These queries were then ran using MySQL Workbench, with screenshots of the code and corresponding outputs below the specified queries. Information regarding the made up organization are included at the beginning of the report.
